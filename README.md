# Real-Time-Comment-Wall
This will be a web application built with HTML, CSS (using Tailwind CSS for styling), and JavaScript. It will allow users to add anonymous comments, "like" or "pin" them, and sort them by time or likes. All comments will persist locally using IndexedDB, so they'll be saved even if you close the browser.

This comment wall provides a clean interface where you can add comments, which will instantly appear on the wall. You can click the heart icon to "like" a comment and the thumbtack icon to "pin" it to the top. The comments are automatically saved using IndexedDB, so they'll be there even if you close and reopen your browser. You can also sort the comments by the time they were posted or by the number of likes they have received.
